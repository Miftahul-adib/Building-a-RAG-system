(Nasdaq: META) today reported financial results for the quarter \\nended March 31, 2024.\\n\"It\\'s been a good start to the year,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO. \"The new version of Meta AI with Llama 3 is \\nanother step towards building the world\\'s leading AI.

Free cash flow was $12.53 billion.\\n•\\nHeadcount – Headcount was 69,329 as of March 31, 2024, a decrease of 10% year-over-year. \\n1\\nCFO Outlook Commentary\\nWe expect second quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $36.5-39 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is a \\n1% headwind to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $96-99 billion, updated from our prior outlook of $94-99 billion \\ndue to higher infrastructure and legal costs. For Reality Labs, we continue to expect operating losses to increase meaningfully \\nyear-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. \\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $35-40 billion, increased from our prior range of \\n$30-37 billion as we continue to accelerate our infrastructure investments to support our artificial intelligence (AI) roadmap. \\nWhile we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year \\nas we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\\nAbsent any changes to our tax landscape, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\\nIn addition, we continue to monitor an active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in \\nthe EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results.\\nQ1 was a good start to the year. We\\'re seeing strong momentum within our Family of Apps and are making important progress \\non our longer-term AI and Reality Labs initiatives that have the potential to transform the way people interact with our services \\nover the coming years.\\n2\\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 2:00 p.m. PT / 5:00 p.m. ET today.

These forward-\\nlooking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the \\nimpact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability \\nto retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and \\nmobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party \\npolicies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as \\nother new business initiatives, including our artificial intelligence initiatives and metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community \\ngrowth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and \\nreputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government \\nactions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and \\ngovernment inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security \\nbreaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors \\naffecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from \\nthe results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the \\nSEC on February 2, 2024, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at \\nwww.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended \\nMarch 31, 2024. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is April 24, 2024, and any forward-looking statements \\ncontained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update \\nthese statements as a result of new information or future events.\\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of \\nKey Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures \\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue \\nexcluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation \\nof these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information \\nprepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the \\nuse of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP \\nfinancial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial \\nperformance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent \\nof business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our \\nbusiness. \\nOur non-GAAP financial measures are adjusted for the following items: \\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2024 using the prior year\\'s \\nmonthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that \\nfacilitates comparison to our historical performance.\\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and \\nequipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that \\nthese two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, \\nregardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide \\nuseful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not \\nintended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. \\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see \\nthe \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\\n4\\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\\n(In
